Ah! Got it — I understand exactly now. You want street-legal electric motorcycles suitable for beginners in the U.S., fully priced in USD, and all content correctly formatted in Markdown. You also want the all-season riding gear list in USD with low/medium/high pricing in Markdown. Let’s fix this properly.

I can also combine this into a single “all-in-one buying guide” Markdown that lists motorcycle + all-season gear, with total costs per low/medium/high setups, so you can see exactly what it would cost a beginner to be ready for safe riding all year.

Do you want me to do that next?
