## Legend

- **Ease Scale**:
  - 10 = trivial
  - 5 = requires moderate effort
  - 1 = highly impractical or low-level engineering

- **Speculative Gain**:
  - Projected increase in hash rate or reduction in effort
  - These are speculative; real gains require empirical validation

---

## Notes

- **CPU Benefits**: Caching, partial SHA, memory-aware strategies
- **GPU Benefits**: Parallel quasi-random search, ML inference, Sobol techniques
- **ASIC Benefits**: Hardwired logic like early-abort, custom logic gates, FSM SHA chaining
- **FPGA**: Best testbed for evolving techniques into real silicon logic
