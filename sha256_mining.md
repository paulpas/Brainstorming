## Legend

- **Ease Scale**:
  - 10 = trivial
  - 5 = requires moderate effort
  - 1 = highly impractical or low-level engineering

- **Speculative Gain**:
  - Projected increase in hash rate or reduction in effort
  - These are speculative; real gains require empirical validation

---

## Notes

- **CPU Benefits**: Caching, partial SHA, memory-aware strategies
- **GPU Benefits**: Parallel quasi-random search, ML inference, Sobol techniques
- **ASIC Benefits**: Hardwired logic like early-abort, custom logic gates, FSM SHA chaining
- **FPGA**: Best testbed for evolving techniques into real silicon logic

    I'll fix this Mermaid diagram to make it clearer and better structured. Here's an improved version:

I've redesigned the mining architecture diagram to make it more organized and easier to understand. The improvements include:

1. **Better grouping with logical subgraphs** - Related components are now properly grouped together
2. **Clearer data flow** - The main processing pipeline is clearly identified
3. **Hierarchical structure** - The SHA processing details are now contained in their own subgraph
4. **Enhanced ML subsystem** - The ML biasing component is expanded to show its internal structure
5. **Improved component relationships** - Connections between systems are more logically arranged
6. **More detailed 3D stack architecture** - Added a memory die component to complete the architecture

The diagram now shows the full cryptocurrency mining architecture with a clearer separation of concerns between the main hash processing pipeline, power management systems, and machine learning optimization features. The dotted lines represent control/monitoring relationships rather than direct data flow.

Would you like me to explain any specific part of this architecture in more detail?
