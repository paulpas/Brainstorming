## Sprint 6 – Enterprise‑Grade Governance, Self‑Healing, and Continuous‑Improvement Loop  

Sprint 6 is the **final polishing phase** that turns the platform built in Sprints 1‑5 into a **fully‑managed, enterprise‑ready service** capable of:

* **Zero‑downtime operation** across multiple data‑centers (active‑active fail‑over).  
* **Self‑healing** of all components (auto‑restart, state‑recovery, graceful degradation).  
* **Model‑governance & auditability** (model provenance, version control, bias monitoring).  
* **Regulatory‑ready compliance** (MiFID II, FINRA, GDPR, CFTC, AML/KYC).  
* **Dynamic, market‑driven scaling** (auto‑provision of compute for spikes, on‑demand GPU for LLM inference).  
* **Business‑continuity & disaster‑recovery** (RPO ≤ 5 min, RTO ≤ 10 min).  
* **Extensible plug‑in ecosystem** (new exchanges, new data sources, new LLMs) with **zero code changes** for the core engine.  

At the end of Sprint 6 you will have a **production‑grade, self‑service trading platform** that can be handed over to an operations team, audited by regulators, and continuously improved without taking the system offline.

## 1️⃣ Self‑Healing & High‑Availability

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1.1 | **Active‑Active K8s clusters** (two AZs / regions) with **Istio‑based traffic split** (50 % each). | `kubectl get pods -A` shows identical replica sets in both clusters; `istioctl proxy-status` reports healthy sidecars. |
| 1.2 | **Pod‑Disruption Budgets (PDB)** for every critical deployment (orchestrator, router, risk engine). | `kubectl get pdb` shows `minAvailable` set to 80 % of replicas. |
| 1.3 | **Auto‑restart & state‑recovery** – use **Kubernetes `livenessProbe`** (HTTP `/healthz`) and **`readinessProbe`** (checks DB connectivity). On failure the pod is killed and a new pod starts, pulling the latest model checkpoint from the Model Registry. | Simulate a deadlock (sleep > liveness timeout); pod restarts automatically. |
| 1.4 | **Graceful degradation** – if an LLM agent becomes unavailable, the orchestrator automatically removes it from the aggregation and logs a *fallback* event. | Shut down the LLM inference service; orchestrator continues with remaining agents and emits a metric `agent_fallback_total`. |
| 1.5 | **Cross‑cluster fail‑over** – Global Load Balancer (e.g., AWS ALB + Route 53 health checks) routes traffic to the healthy cluster within < 5 s of a failure. | Stop all pods in Cluster A; DNS health check marks it unhealthy; traffic switches to Cluster B (verified via `curl -H "Host: api.trading"`). |
| 1.6 | **Unit‑test** – use **Chaos Mesh** to kill a pod, verify that the PDB prevents total service loss and that the Service Mesh retries succeed. | `test_self_healing_chaos.py`. |

---

## 2️⃣ Model Governance & Provenance

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 2.1 | **MLflow Model Registry** – every RL checkpoint, LLM prompt version, and rule‑based config is registered with a **semantic version** (`v2024.09.08‑rl‑v1`). | `mlflow models list` shows the new version with tags `git_sha`, `data_snapshot_id`, `risk_profile`. |
| 2.2 | **Model lineage graph** – store a DAG in the Governance DB linking: data snapshot → feature set → model → deployment. Visualised in a Grafana panel (via Neo4j plugin). | Adding a new model automatically creates a node and edges; the graph shows the full lineage for any deployed model. |
| 2.3 | **Bias & fairness monitoring** – compute per‑symbol SHAP importance drift and LLM sentiment skew (e.g., systematic bullish bias). Alerts fire if drift > 10 % over 24 h. | Simulate a biased dataset; the bias metric exceeds threshold and a PagerDuty incident is created. |
| 2.4 | **Model signing** – each model artifact is signed with a **private key** (cosign) and verified at load time. | Tampering with the checkpoint file causes the orchestrator to reject the model and fall back to the previous version. |
| 2.5 | **Approval workflow** – a GitHub‑Actions‑triggered **pull‑request** creates a *model‑review* issue; only after two approvers sign off does the model get promoted to `Production`. | PR merged → model moves from `Staging` to `Production` automatically. |
| 2.6 | **Unit‑test** – register a dummy model, sign it, corrupt the file, and assert that the loader raises a verification error. | `test_model_governance.py`. |

---

## 3️⃣ Regulatory & Compliance Suite

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 3.1 | **Transaction‑level audit log** – every order (create, amend, cancel, fill) is written to an **append‑only, tamper‑evident** table (`trade_audit`) with a **hash chain** (`prev_hash = SHA256(prev_hash || json_row)`). |
| 3.2 | **Regulatory export service** – a secure FastAPI endpoint (`/regulatory/export`) that generates **ISO 20022‑compatible** XML/JSON files for a given reporting period (daily, weekly, monthly). |
| 3.3 | **KYC/AML integration** – before any order is sent to an exchange, the system checks the user’s AML risk score (via an external provider) and blocks high‑risk accounts. |
| 3.4 | **GDPR “right‑to‑be‑forgotten”** – a deletion API that removes personal identifiers from the audit log, re‑hashes the chain, and stores a **deletion receipt** (signed). |
| 3.5 | **MiFID II best‑execution reporting** – automatically captures the *execution venue*, *price*, *size*, *timestamp*, and *reason* (algorithmic, manual) for each trade; stored in `best_execution` table. |
| 3.6 | **Compliance unit‑tests** – generate a synthetic trade day, run the export service, and validate the XML against the official schema (`xmllint --schema miFID2.xsd`). |
| 3.7 | **Automated audit** – nightly job runs a **static analysis** of the audit tables, verifies hash chain integrity, and sends a summary to the compliance mailbox. |

---

## 4️⃣ Dynamic, Market‑Driven Scaling (GPU & Compute)

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 4.1 | **Cluster‑autoscaler with GPU node‑pools** – when the **LLM inference latency** (`agent_latency_seconds`) exceeds a threshold (e.g., 1 s), the autoscaler adds a GPU node to the pool. |
| 4.2 | **Spot‑instance fallback** – GPU nodes can be provisioned on **spot/preemptible** instances; a daemon monitors preemption events and gracefully drains pods. |
| 4.3 | **Serverless inference fallback** – if the GPU pool is saturated, the orchestrator routes LLM calls to a **managed serverless endpoint** (e.g., AWS SageMaker Serverless) with a higher latency budget. |
| 4.4 | **Cost‑monitoring dashboard** – Grafana panel shows GPU‑hour usage, spot‑vs‑on‑demand cost split, and a cost‑per‑trade metric. |
| 4.5 | **Unit‑test** – artificially inflate `agent_latency_seconds` via a mock; verify that the autoscaler creates a new GPU node (checked via the K8s API). |

---

## 5️⃣ Extensible Plug‑In Ecosystem

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 5.1 | **Plugin SDK** – a Python package (`crypto_bot_sdk`) that defines abstract base classes for **DataSource**, **Agent**, **ExchangeAdapter**, and **RiskRule**. |
| 5.2 | **Dynamic discovery** – plugins are packaged as Docker images and registered in a **Helm chart values** list (`plugins:`). The orchestrator loads them at startup via a **side‑car init container** that pulls the images and registers the entry points. |
| 5.3 | **Versioned API contract** – each plugin must expose a `manifest.json` with `api_version`, `compatible_core_version`, and `capabilities`. The core validates compatibility before loading. |
| 5.4 | **Sample plugins** – (a) **Binance Futures Adapter**, (b) **DeFi TVL DataSource**, (c) **Sentiment‑as‑Service LLM** (hosted on Azure). |
| 5.5 | **Integration test** – add a new plugin to `values.yaml`, run `helm upgrade`, and assert that the new data source appears in the monitoring dashboard and that its metrics are emitted. |
| 5.6 | **Documentation** – a “Plugin Development Guide” with code templates, CI pipeline example, and publishing checklist. |

---

## 6️⃣ Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 6.1 | **RPO ≤ 5 min** – TimescaleDB and Governance DB are replicated to a **different region** using **logical replication**; snapshots are taken every 2 min and stored in an immutable S3 bucket (Object Lock). |
| 6.2 | **RTO ≤ 10 min** – a **run‑book** that spins up the DR cluster from the latest snapshots (Terraform + Helm) and redirects traffic via DNS fail‑over. Tested quarterly. |
| 6.3 | **Cold‑standby GPU pool** – a minimal GPU node set (1 node) kept running in the DR region; when DR is activated, the autoscaler can instantly scale to the required size. |
| 6.4 | **Data‑consistency checks** – nightly job compares row counts and checksums between primary and DR databases; any mismatch raises a high‑severity alert. |
| 6.5 | **DR drill automation** – a script (`dr_drill.sh`) that simulates a full region outage, triggers the fail‑over, runs a smoke test (place a paper‑trade), and then rolls back. |
| 6.6 | **Test** – execute `dr_drill.sh`; verify that the system is back online within 9 min and that no trade data is lost (row count identical). |

---

## 7️⃣ Advanced Risk & Stress‑Testing Framework

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 7.1 | **Scenario Engine** – a DSL (YAML) to describe market shocks (price drops, exchange halts, regulatory bans). The engine can replay a scenario on historical data or in a live sandbox. |
| 7.2 | **Monte‑Carlo VaR** – run 10 k simulated paths per day using the **copula‑based correlation matrix** of the top‑50 symbols; compute 99 % VaR and compare against the risk budget. |
| 7.3 | **Liquidity‑stress module** – inject artificial order‑book depth reductions (e.g., 90 % depth removed) and verify that the **slippage guard** aborts orders as expected. |
| 7.4 | **Regulatory stress tests** – generate a “Basel‑III‑style” stress scenario (market‑wide 30 % drop) and produce a compliance report automatically. |
| 7.5 | **Alerting** – if any stress‑test metric exceeds a pre‑defined limit, a high‑severity PagerDuty incident is opened. |
| 7.6 | **Unit‑test** – run a “price‑crash” scenario on a synthetic portfolio and assert that the projected loss matches the analytical calculation. |

---

## 8️⃣ Observability, Explainability & KPI Dashboard

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 8.1 | **Unified tracing** – enable **OpenTelemetry** across all services; traces flow from market‑data ingestion → agent inference → decision engine → exchange adapter. |
| 8.2 | **Explainability panel** – for each executed trade, display: <br>• SHAP contribution of each technical feature <br>• LLM rationale word‑cloud <br>• Meta‑learner confidence score. |
| 8.3 | **KPI dashboard** – daily/weekly metrics: Sharpe, Sortino, max‑drawdown, ROI per exchange, model‑version performance, latency breakdown, GPU utilisation. |
| 8.4 | **Anomaly detection** – a lightweight unsupervised model (Isolation Forest) monitors metric streams; spikes trigger alerts. |
| 8.5 | **Unit‑test** – inject a synthetic latency spike; verify that the trace shows the retry path and that the anomaly detector raises an alert. |

---

## 9️⃣ Run‑Books, SOPs & Knowledge Transfer

| # | Item | Done‑criterion |
|---|------|----------------|
| 9.1 | **Incident‑Response Playbook** – detailed steps for: (a) Exchange API outage, (b) LLM service degradation, (c) GPU node loss, (d) Data‑center failure. Includes run‑books scripts (`./scripts/handle_exchange_outage.sh`). |
| 9.2 | **Model‑Promotion SOP** – checklist: (a) validation on hold‑out set, (b) A/B shadow test results, (c) governance approval, (d) rollout plan, (e) post‑deployment monitoring window. |
| 9.3 | **Compliance‑Reporting SOP** – schedule, responsible owners, data‑retention policy, audit‑log verification steps. |
| 9.4 | **On‑boarding guide** – for new engineers: local dev environment (KinD + Tilt), CI pipeline, debugging tips. |
| 9.5 | **Knowledge‑base** – Confluence space with architecture diagrams, data‑flow charts, FAQ, and a “plugin‑submission” form. |
| 9.6 | **Unit‑test** – run a lint script that checks each markdown file for required sections (`## Incident Response`). |

## 11️⃣ Sprint 6 Demo Checklist

1. **Zero‑downtime fail‑over** – bring down the primary region; traffic automatically switches to the secondary region; a paper‑trade placed during the switch is executed successfully.  
2. **Self‑healing** – kill the `news_agent` pod; the orchestrator logs a fallback, the pod restarts, and the system continues without order loss.  
3. **Model governance** – register a new RL checkpoint, sign it, promote it via the approval workflow, and see the new version instantly used by the live orchestrator.  
4. **Regulatory export** – generate a daily ISO 20022 report, validate it against the schema, and download it via the secure endpoint.  
5. **Dynamic scaling** – artificially increase LLM latency; the autoscaler adds a GPU node; Grafana shows the new GPU‑hour count.  
6. **Plugin addition** – deploy a new **Binance Futures Adapter** plugin via Helm values; the system begins routing orders to Binance without code changes.  
7. **Stress‑test scenario** – run a “30 % market crash” scenario in the sandbox; the risk engine aborts high‑exposure orders and the alert panel lights up.  
8. **Explainability view** – select a recent trade; the dashboard shows SHAP bars, LLM rationale word‑cloud, and the meta‑learner confidence score.  
9. **Disaster‑recovery drill** – execute `dr_drill.sh`; the DR cluster comes online in 8 min, all services are healthy, and no trade data is lost.  
10. **Run‑book execution** – trigger the “exchange outage” playbook; the scripted steps close positions, send notifications, and the system recovers.  

When the demo passes, the platform is **enterprise‑grade, fully auditable, and capable of operating 24/7 across regions** while continuously improving its models and respecting every regulatory requirement.
