## Sprint 7 – Enterprise‑Scale Continuous‑Improvement & Future‑Proofing  

Sprint 7 is the **final polishing & expansion sprint** that takes the production‑grade platform built in Sprints 1‑6 and makes it **future‑ready**.  
The focus is on:

| 🎯 Goal | Why it matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **A. Real‑time, on‑chain execution** | Capture arbitrage & liquidity opportunities that exist only on DEXes (Uniswap, SushiSwap, PancakeSwap, etc.). |
| **B. Multi‑agent coordination & hierarchical decision‑making** | Let specialized agents (price‑action, macro‑news, on‑chain, sentiment) negotiate a joint plan rather than a simple weighted average. |
| **C. Full‑stack observability & automated root‑cause analysis** | Reduce MTTR from minutes to seconds when something goes wrong. |
| **D. Continuous model‑as‑a‑service (MaaS) pipeline** | Deploy new RL checkpoints, new LLM prompts, or new rule‑sets without touching the core code base. |
| **E. Regulatory & governance automation for new jurisdictions** | Add support for emerging crypto‑regulations (e.g., EU MiCA, Singapore MAS) with minimal manual effort. |
| **F. Business‑level SLAs & SLOs** | Formalise reliability targets (99.9 % uptime, 95 th‑percentile latency < 500 ms, < 0.1 % order‑rejection rate). |
| **G. Extensible plug‑in marketplace** | Allow internal teams or external partners to publish “plugins” (new data sources, new execution venues, custom risk rules) that can be discovered and installed at runtime. |
| **H. Automated post‑trade analytics & profit‑center reporting** | Turn every trade into a reusable case study that feeds back into model training and business reporting. |

Below is a **task‑by‑task breakdown** that can be completed in a **2‑week sprint**. Each task includes a **definition of done**, **key technologies**, and **test / validation** ideas.

---

## 1️⃣ On‑Chain Execution Engine (DEX Integration)

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Tech / Tools | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 1.1 | **Unified DEX adapter interface** (`BaseDEXAdapter`) with methods `quote()`, `swap()`, `get_pool_state()`. | Interface compiled, concrete adapters for **Uniswap V3**, **SushiSwap**, **PancakeSwap** implement it. | Unit‑test each adapter against a local **Hardhat** or **Ganache** fork (mock pool state, verify slippage calculation). |
| 1.2 | **Atomic multi‑hop routing** – a service that stitches together multiple pool swaps to achieve the best price (e.g., ETH → USDC via 2‑hop). | Given a token pair, `router.get_best_path()` returns a list of pool IDs and expected output. | Integration test on a testnet (e.g., Goerli) that executes a 2‑hop swap and checks on‑chain receipt. |
| 1.3 | **Gas‑budget & fee estimator** – predicts gas cost, adds it to the order‑size calculation, aborts if total cost > max‑budget (configurable per‑symbol). | `estimate_gas()` returns a numeric estimate; order is rejected when `total_cost > budget`. | Mock gas price spikes; verify order is blocked and an alert is emitted. |
| 1.4 | **On‑chain event listener** – subscribes to `Swap` events via **WebSocket** (Infura/Alchemy) and writes them to Kafka (`dex_events`). | Real‑time events appear in the topic; consumer updates `trade_ledger` with on‑chain fill data. | End‑to‑end test: trigger a swap on a testnet, ensure the event is captured and the ledger row is created within 2 s. |
| 1.5 | **Safety guard** – before sending a DEX transaction, run a **simulation** (`eth_call` with `stateOverride`) to ensure the trade will not revert. | Simulation returns `success=true`; if `false`, order is cancelled. | Unit‑test with a deliberately failing swap (e.g., insufficient liquidity) – simulation catches it. |
| 1.6 | **Compliance wrapper** – automatically tag DEX trades with `venue=DEX`, `protocol=UniswapV3`, and store the on‑chain transaction hash for audit. | Ledger row contains `venue`, `protocol`, `tx_hash`. | Verify exported regulatory report includes DEX trades. |

---

## 2️⃣ Hierarchical Multi‑Agent Coordination

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Tech / Tools | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2.1 | **Agent hierarchy definition** – top‑level **CoordinatorAgent** that receives proposals from leaf agents (NewsAgent, OnChainAgent, TechnicalAgent, MacroAgent). | Coordinator API (`propose(action)`) exists and can be called asynchronously. | Mock three leaf agents, verify coordinator aggregates proposals into a single `JointPlan`. |
| 2.2 | **Negotiation protocol** – implement a lightweight **Contract‑Net** style protocol: agents submit **utility scores** for each possible action; coordinator selects the action that maximises a weighted sum (weights are dynamic). | Protocol messages (`CFP`, `PROPOSE`, `ACCEPT`, `REJECT`) are defined in protobuf and exchanged via Kafka topics (`agent_negotiation`). | Simulate a conflict (NewsAgent wants BUY, TechnicalAgent wants SELL); verify coordinator picks the higher‑utility side. |
| 2.3 | **Dynamic weight adaptation** – a small reinforcement‑learning bandit (UCB1) learns the optimal weight for each agent based on recent realised P&L contribution. | Weight vector updates after each trade; persisted in Redis. | Run a synthetic environment where one agent is deliberately noisy; verify its weight decays over 100 trades. |
| 2.4 | **Explainability of the joint decision** – store the full negotiation transcript in the `explainability` table; expose via API `/trade/{id}/negotiation`. | API returns JSON with timestamps, proposals, utilities, final decision. | Pull a recent trade, check that the transcript matches the expected flow. |
| 2.5 | **Fail‑over for agents** – if a leaf agent crashes, the coordinator automatically re‑weights remaining agents and continues. | Simulated crash of `OnChainAgent` leads to a log entry “Agent down – re‑weighting”. | Chaos‑Mesh kill of the agent pod; verify system stays operational and logs re‑weighting. |

## 3️⃣ Full‑Stack Observability & Automated RCA (Root‑Cause Analysis)

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Tech / Tools | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 3.1 | **OpenTelemetry end‑to‑end tracing** – propagate trace IDs from market‑data ingestion → agent negotiation → execution router → exchange adapter. | All services emit spans; trace can be visualised in **Jaeger** or **Grafana Tempo**. | Trigger a trade, open the trace, verify each hop appears with correct latency. |
| 3.2 | **Log enrichment** – add fields `trace_id`, `span_id`, `symbol`, `policy_version` to every JSON log line (via **Fluent Bit**). | Logs in Loki contain the new fields; searchable by `trace_id`. | Search for a known `trace_id` and confirm all related logs appear. |
| 3.3 | **Automated RCA engine** – a service that, on detection of an anomaly (e.g., latency spike, order‑rejection surge), pulls the related traces & logs, runs a **pattern‑matching** rule set, and creates a **Jira ticket** with a preliminary root‑cause hypothesis. | Anomaly → ticket created within 30 s, containing trace snapshot and log excerpts. | Simulate a 5 × latency spike in the `NewsAgent`; verify ticket is opened with correct details. |
| 3.4 | **Anomaly detection models** – deploy two lightweight models: (a) **Statistical** (EWMA on latency, error rate), (b) **ML** (Isolation Forest on multi‑metric vector). | Both models emit Prometheus alerts when thresholds breached. | Inject synthetic outliers; confirm alerts fire and RCA ticket is generated. |
| 3.5 | **SLO dashboard** – Grafana panel showing 95 th‑percentile latency, error‑rate, and SLA breach percentage per service. | Dashboard updates in real time; SLA breach > 0.1 % triggers a PagerDuty incident. | Force a breach (e.g., set error‑rate to 0.2 %); verify incident is created. |

---

## 4️⃣ Continuous Model‑as‑a‑Service (MaaS) Pipeline

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Tech / Tools | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 4.1 | **Model registry API** – extend **MLflow** with a custom REST endpoint `/models/activate` that marks a specific version as *production* and triggers a hot‑swap in the orchestrator. | `curl -X POST /models/activate -d {"name":"rl_policy","version":"2024.09.15"}` returns `202 Accepted`. | Verify that the orchestrator loads the new checkpoint within 30 s (check `model_version` metric). |
| 4.2 | **Zero‑downtime hot‑swap** – orchestrator runs two inference containers side‑by‑side (old & new). Traffic is gradually shifted using a **weighted routing** rule in Istio (`traffic-split`). | After activation, 100 % of traffic flows to the new container without order loss. | Simulate a model upgrade; monitor that no orders are rejected during the transition. |
| 4.3 | **Prompt‑versioning service** – store LLM prompt templates in a **Git‑backed ConfigMap**; each change creates a new `prompt_version` tag. Orchestrator fetches the latest version at start‑up. | Updating the ConfigMap triggers a rolling restart of the LLM inference pods; new prompts are used immediately. | Change a prompt line, watch pods restart, and verify new responses contain the updated wording. |
| 4.4 | **A/B testing framework** – a side‑car that routes a configurable % of traffic to a *candidate* model while the rest uses the *control* model. Metrics are logged per bucket. | Dashboard shows separate Sharpe, win‑rate, and latency for control vs. candidate. | Deploy a candidate RL checkpoint, set traffic split to 10 %; after 2 h, verify metrics are collected and displayed. |
| 4.5 | **Automated promotion policy** – a CI job that evaluates A/B results (statistical significance) and, if criteria met, calls `/models/activate` automatically. | Successful promotion occurs without manual intervention when KPI improvement > 5 % with p‑value < 0.01. | Run a synthetic candidate that outperforms control; confirm auto‑promotion. |

## 5️⃣ Regulatory Automation for New Jurisdictions

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Tech / Tools | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 5.1 | **Regulation matrix** – a JSON/YAML file (`regulations.yaml`) that maps **jurisdiction → required fields / reporting format** (e.g., EU MiCA, Singapore MAS, US CFTC). | File includes at least three jurisdictions with distinct schemas. | Unit‑test that loads the file and validates schema definitions. |
| 5.2 | **Dynamic report generator** – a service that, given a jurisdiction code, pulls the required fields from the audit trail and emits the correct format (XML, CSV, JSON). | `GET /report/miCA?date=2024-09-08` returns a valid MiCA‑compliant XML. | Validate the XML against the MiCA XSD. |
| 5.3 | **KYC/AML jurisdiction routing** – when a user registers, the onboarding service checks their residence and applies the appropriate AML checks (e.g., PEP screening for EU, FATF list for US). | User from Germany gets EU AML provider; user from Singapore gets MAS provider. | Mock user profiles, verify correct provider is called. |
| 5.4 | **Compliance alerting** – if a trade violates a jurisdiction‑specific rule (e.g., max‑position size in a restricted market), an alert is raised and the order is rejected. | Trade exceeding EU max‑position triggers a Slack alert and is logged as `compliance_violation`. | Simulate a violating trade; verify rejection and alert. |
| 5.5 | **Automated audit‑log archiving** – per‑jurisdiction retention policies (e.g., 5 years for EU, 7 years for US) are enforced by a scheduled job that moves old rows to cold storage (Glacier, Nearline). | After 5 years, EU rows are moved to Glacier; a verification script confirms the move. | Run the archiving job on a test dataset with mock timestamps; check final locations. |

---

## 6️⃣ Business‑Level SLAs & SLOs

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 6.1 | **Define SLA contracts** – formal documents for internal stakeholders: <br>• Uptime ≥ 99.9 % (monthly) <br>• 95 th‑percentile order‑to‑fill latency ≤ 500 ms <br>• Order‑rejection rate ≤ 0.1 % |
| 6.2 | **SLO monitoring** – Prometheus alerts for each SLA metric with warning (80 % of threshold) and breach levels. |
| 6.3 | **Error‑budget calculator** – a Grafana panel that shows remaining error budget for the month and predicts breach date based on current trend. |
| 6.4 | **SLA reporting** – automated monthly PDF sent to compliance & finance, summarising uptime, latency, error‑budget consumption, and any breach remediation actions. |
| 6.5 | **Test** – inject a latency spike that pushes 95 th‑percentile to 600 ms; verify that the warning alert fires, the error‑budget panel updates, and the breach email is queued. |

---

## 7️⃣ Plug‑in Marketplace & Runtime Discovery

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 7.1 | **Marketplace API** – a REST service (`/plugins`) that lists available plug‑ins, their versions, compatibility matrix, and a short description. |
| 7.2 | **Plug‑in packaging** – each plug‑in is a Docker image that implements the SDK interfaces and publishes a `manifest.json` (including `api_version`, `capabilities`, `maintainer`). |
| 7.3 | **Runtime installer** – a CLI (`pluginctl install <image>`) that pulls the image, validates the manifest, and updates the Helm `values.yaml` automatically. |
| 7.4 | **Security sandbox** – plug‑ins run in a **Kubernetes pod with a restricted PSP / PodSecurityPolicy** (no hostNetwork, read‑only rootfs, limited CPU/memory). |
| 7.5 | **Verification test** – publish a dummy plug‑in that simply logs “hello”; install it via `pluginctl`; verify that it appears in the marketplace and that its logs are visible in Loki. |
| 7.6 | **Governance** – every new plug‑in must pass a CI scan (Trivy, Owasp‑dependency‑check) and be approved by the **Governance Board** before being promoted to `production` status. |

---

## 8️⃣ Post‑Trade Analytics & Profit‑Center Reporting

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 8.1 | **Trade‑enrichment pipeline** – after a trade is settled, enrich the record with: <br>• Attribution to each agent (utility score) <br>• Market conditions (volatility, order‑book depth) <br>• Execution quality (slippage, fill‑rate) |
| 8.2 | **Profit‑center aggregation** – group trades by **business unit** (e.g., “Arbitrage”, “Trend‑Following”, “DeFi‑Yield”) and compute P&L, Sharpe, turnover. |
| 8.3 | **Interactive reporting UI** – a React/Next.js dashboard where product managers can filter by date, symbol, venue, or profit‑center and export CSV/Excel. |
| 8.4 | **Feedback loop** – the aggregated attribution data is fed back into the RL trainer as an additional reward component (e.g., “agent‑contribution reward”). |
| 8.5 | **Test** – run a batch of synthetic trades with known agent utilities; verify that the profit‑center report correctly attributes the P&L. |

---

## 9️⃣ Testing, CI & Release Automation (Final Polish)

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 9.1 | **Chaos‑Engineering suite** – schedule weekly LitmusChaos experiments that (a) kill a DEX adapter pod, (b) inject high latency in the LLM service, (c) corrupt a Redis cache entry. All must recover automatically. |
| 9.2 | **Performance benchmark** – run a load test (k6) that simulates 50 k messages / sec across all ingestion pipelines; ensure 95 % of messages are processed within 200 ms. |
| 9.3 | **End‑to‑end regression test** – a single GitHub Action that spins up a full multi‑cluster environment (primary + DR) on Kind, runs a 5‑minute live‑trading simulation (paper‑trading), then validates: <br>• No order loss <br>• Correct audit‑log chain <br>• SLA metrics within targets |
| 9.4 | **Coverage gate** – `coverage run -m pytest && coverage report -m` must be **≥ 95 %** (including integration tests). |
| 9.5 | **Release checklist automation** – a GitHub Action that, on tag creation, runs: <br>1. Build & push all Docker images <br>2. Run the full regression suite <br>3. Generate a release note (auto‑extracted from PR titles) <br>4. Deploy to a **staging** environment and run smoke tests <br>5. If all pass, promote to **production** via Helm. |
| 9.6 | **Documentation CI** – lint all Markdown/Confluence files, verify internal links, and publish a static site (`mkdocs`) as part of the pipeline. |

## 11️⃣ Sprint 7 Demo Checklist

1. **On‑chain trade** – execute a real swap on a Goerli testnet (ETH → USDC) via the DEX router; show the transaction hash, gas‑cost estimate, and ledger entry.  
2. **Multi‑agent joint plan** – trigger a scenario where NewsAgent proposes BUY, TechnicalAgent proposes SELL; display the negotiation transcript and the final coordinated action.  
3. **Hot‑swap RL model** – promote a new RL checkpoint via the MaaS API; demonstrate that new trades use the updated policy without any order interruption.  
4. **Regulatory report** – generate a MiCA‑compliant XML for the previous day, validate against the XSD, and download it.  
5. **SLA breach simulation** – artificially increase order‑rejection rate to 0.2 %; verify that the warning alert fires, the error‑budget panel updates, and a breach email is queued.  
6. **Plug‑in installation** – use `pluginctl install myorg/custom‑risk‑rule:1.0.0`; show the plug‑in appear in the marketplace UI and that its risk rule is applied to subsequent trades.  
7. **RCA ticket** – cause a latency spike in the NewsAgent; watch the automated RCA service create a Jira ticket with trace & log excerpts.  
8. **Profit‑center report** – open the post‑trade analytics dashboard, filter by “Arbitrage” profit‑center, and export a CSV showing P&L, Sharpe, and agent attribution.  
9. **Disaster‑recovery fail‑over** – run the DR drill script; confirm the secondary cluster takes over within the RTO target (≤ 10 min) and no trade data is lost.  
10. **Chaos‑mesh resilience** – kill a DEX adapter pod; verify the system re‑routes to the next best pool and continues processing.  

When the demo passes, the platform is **future‑proof**: it can ingest new on‑chain venues, coordinate sophisticated agents, self‑heal, adapt its models automatically, satisfy emerging regulations, and provide the business with transparent, auditable performance metrics.
