## Sprint 5 – Production‑Grade Scaling, Meta‑Learning & Continuous‑Improvement  

Sprint 5 is the **final polishing phase** that turns the prototype built in Sprints 1‑4 into a **robust, cloud‑native, self‑optimising trading platform** that can run **hundreds of symbols on dozens of exchanges**, **auto‑tune** its models, **audit** every decision, and **recover** from any failure without human intervention.

At the end of Sprint 5 you will have:

| ✅ | Deliverable |
|----|-------------|
| 1 | **Kubernetes‑native deployment** (Helm chart + CI/CD) that can be rolled out to any cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure) or on‑prem. |
| 2 | **Horizontal autoscaling** for ingestion workers, agents, RL trainers, and the order router (based on CPU, memory, and custom Prometheus metrics). |
| 3 | **Meta‑learning layer** that automatically selects the best‑performing LLM agent, RL policy, or rule‑based fallback for each symbol/exchange combination (context‑aware model selection). |
| 4 | **Automated hyper‑parameter optimisation** (Optuna / Ray Tune) that runs nightly experiments on a validation set and promotes the best checkpoint to production. |
| 5 | **Full audit trail & compliance package** (tamper‑evident logs, GDPR‑friendly data‑retention, exportable CSV/JSON reports). |
| 6 | **Canary & blue‑green release framework** with automated rollback on KPI regression. |
| 7 | **Advanced risk‑engine extensions** (portfolio‑level VaR, stress‑testing, scenario analysis, dynamic margin allocation). |
| 8 | **Explainability dashboard** (SHAP values for technical features, LLM‑generated rationale, attribution of profit/loss to each data source). |
| 9 | **Comprehensive test suite** (unit, integration, chaos‑engineering, performance) with CI coverage ≥ 95 %. |
|10 | **Run‑books & SOPs** for incident response, model‑upgrade, regulatory reporting, and disaster recovery. |

Below is a **task‑by‑task breakdown** (≈ 2 weeks). Each task lists a concrete “Done” criterion, the key technologies, and suggested unit‑/integration‑test ideas.

---

## 1️⃣ Kubernetes‑Native Deployment & CI/CD

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 1.1 | **Docker‑image hygiene** – multi‑stage Dockerfiles for each service (ingestor, orchestrator, RL trainer, router, auditor). Images are scanned with **Trivy** and signed with **cosign**. | `docker scan` reports no critical CVEs; `cosign verify` succeeds. |
| 1.2 | **Helm chart** (`crypto‑bot/`) that defines Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets (Vault‑injected), and **HorizontalPodAutoscaler** objects for every micro‑service. | `helm install --dry-run` renders a valid manifest; `kubectl get hpa` shows autoscaling objects. |
| 1.3 | **GitHub Actions pipeline** – on push to `main`: <br>• Build & push images to ECR/GCR <br>• Run unit & integration tests <br>• Run `helm lint` <br>• Deploy to a **staging** namespace using **Argo CD** (or `helm upgrade`). | CI badge shows “passing”; staging cluster receives the new release without downtime. |
| 1.4 | **Canary deployment** – Helm values `canary.enabled=true` spin up a replica set with 5 % of traffic (via an Envoy/NGINX ingress weighted routing). Metrics are compared before full promotion. | After a canary rollout, Grafana shows `canary_success_rate` > 99 % and the promotion script proceeds automatically. |
| 1.5 | **Rollback automation** – a GitHub Action that, on detection of a KPI regression (e.g., Sharpe drops > 10 % for 3 consecutive windows), runs `helm rollback` to the previous release. | Simulate a regression; the action triggers and the previous version becomes live within < 2 min. |
| 1.6 | **Unit‑tests** – use `pytest‑docker` to spin up a lightweight KinD cluster, install the chart, and assert that all pods reach `Ready` state. | `test_k8s_deployment.py`. |

---

## 2️⃣ Horizontal Autoscaling & Custom Metrics

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 2.1 | **Prometheus Adapter** – expose custom metrics (`agent_latency_seconds`, `rl_training_step_time`, `order_queue_length`) to the Kubernetes **custom‑metrics‑api**. | `kubectl get --raw "/apis/custom.metrics.k8s.io/v1beta1/namespaces/default/pods/*/agent_latency_seconds"` returns values. |
| 2.2 | **HPA policies** – e.g., `ingestor` scales on CPU > 70 % **or** `agent_latency_seconds` > 1.5 s; `rl_trainer` scales on `rl_training_step_time` > 5 s. | Load test (using `locust` or `k6`) triggers scaling; `kubectl get hpa` shows increased replica count. |
| 2.3 | **Cluster‑autoscaler** – enable node‑pool auto‑scaling on the chosen cloud (AWS EKS Managed Node Groups, GKE Autopilot, etc.). | Simulated burst of 10 k messages per second results in the cluster adding a new node within 3 min. |
| 2.4 | **Chaos‑Monkey tests** – use **LitmusChaos** to kill random pods, inject network latency, or throttle CPU, verifying that the system recovers without order loss. | After a pod kill, the order‑router re‑queues the in‑flight order and the ledger shows a successful fill. |
| 2.5 | **Unit‑test** – mock the custom‑metrics API and assert that the HPA object’s `metrics` field matches the expected spec. | `test_hpa_custom_metrics.py`. |

---

## 3️⃣ Meta‑Learning – Context‑Aware Model Selection

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 3.1 | **Feature‑level meta‑learner** – a lightweight Gradient‑Boosted Tree (`CatBoost`) that, given a snapshot of the market (volatility, liquidity, news‑sentiment distribution, exchange‑specific fee), predicts which **policy** (RL‑v1, RL‑v2, Hybrid‑v1, Hybrid‑v2) will yield the highest expected Sharpe for the next `Δt`. | Model is trained on historic data (last 6 months) and stored as `meta_policy.pkl`. |
| 3.2 | **Policy registry** – JSON file (`policies.yaml`) that maps a policy name to the concrete implementation (e.g., `rl_v1`, `hybrid_v2`). The orchestrator queries the meta‑learner before each decision tick and loads the selected policy dynamically. | Adding a new policy entry makes it instantly selectable by the meta‑learner. |
| 3.3 | **Online evaluation** – after each trade, compute the **realised reward** and feed it back to the meta‑learner’s online update (using `river` incremental learning). | Over a 24 h window, the meta‑learner’s selection accuracy improves from 55 % to > 70 %. |
| 3.4 | **A/B shadow testing** – run a parallel “candidate” meta‑learner on a subset of symbols (10 % traffic) and compare KPI uplift before promotion. | Dashboard shows `candidate_sharpe` > `baseline_sharpe` for at least 3 consecutive windows. |
| 3.5 | **Unit‑test** – mock a set of market snapshots, verify that the meta‑learner returns the expected policy ID, and that the orchestrator loads the correct class. | `test_meta_policy_selection.py`. |

---

## 4️⃣ Automated Hyper‑Parameter Optimisation (Optuna / Ray Tune)

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 4.1 | **Search space definition** – for each RL policy: learning‑rate, entropy‑coeff, batch‑size, target‑return threshold; for each LLM agent: temperature, max‑tokens, system‑prompt version. |
| 4.2 | **Experiment runner** – a Kubernetes **Job** that pulls the latest data, runs an Optuna study (or Ray Tune) for a fixed budget (e.g., 2 h), stores the best hyper‑parameters in a ConfigMap (`best_hparams.yaml`). |
| 4.3 | **Promotion pipeline** – after the study finishes, a GitHub Action validates that the new KPI (Sharpe, max‑drawdown) improves > 5 % on a hold‑out validation set; if so, it updates the production ConfigMap and triggers a rolling restart. |
| 4.4 | **Result archiving** – all trial logs are stored in an S3 bucket (or GCS) with metadata (git SHA, dataset version) for reproducibility. |
| 4.5 | **Unit‑test** – run a tiny Optuna study on synthetic data (e.g., a quadratic function) and assert that the best trial parameters are saved to the ConfigMap. | `test_optuna_pipeline.py`. |

---

## 5️⃣ Full Audit Trail & Compliance Package

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 5.1 | **Tamper‑evident ledger** – write each trade record to **Append‑Only** PostgreSQL tables with **cryptographic hash chaining** (`prev_hash = SHA256(prev_hash || row_json)`). Periodically snapshot the chain to an immutable object store (AWS S3 Object Lock). |
| 5.2 | **GDPR‑friendly data handling** – separate **personal data** (e.g., Twitter user IDs) from trade data; provide a deletion API that scrubs the user‑related rows and re‑hashes the chain (with a proof‑of‑re‑hash). |
| 5.3 | **Regulatory reporting** – generate a daily CSV/JSON file containing: <br>• Trade ID, timestamp, symbol, exchange, side, qty, price, fees <br>• Model version (RL checkpoint hash, LLM prompt version) <br>• Risk‑engine flags (VaR, exposure). |
| 5.4 | **Export service** – a FastAPI endpoint (`/report/daily`) that streams the report, protected by OAuth2 scopes (`report:read`). |
| 5.5 | **Unit‑test** – insert a series of trades, verify that `prev_hash` chaining works (hash of row n + 1 matches stored value) and that the deletion API removes the user data while preserving chain integrity. | `test_audit_chain.py`. |

---

## 6️⃣ Advanced Risk Engine Extensions

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion | Test / Validation |
|---|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 6.1 | **Portfolio‑level VaR** – compute a 1‑day 99 % VaR using Monte‑Carlo simulation of correlated returns (drawn from the technical‑indicator covariance matrix). If VaR exceeds a configurable limit, the engine throttles new entries. |
| 6.2 | **Stress‑testing scenarios** – pre‑defined shock files (e.g., “50 % BTC crash”, “exchange outage”, “regulatory ban”) that are applied to the current portfolio to estimate worst‑case loss. Results are logged and sent to Slack. |
| 6.3 | **Dynamic margin allocation** – adjust per‑symbol max‑exposure based on recent volatility (e.g., `max_exposure = base * (ATR_target / current_ATR)`). |
| 6.4 | **Cross‑exchange arbitrage guard** – detect when the same symbol has divergent prices across exchanges; if the spread exceeds a threshold, automatically generate a hedged arbitrage order (long on cheap, short on expensive). |
| 6.5 | **Unit‑test** – feed a synthetic portfolio, apply a stress scenario, and assert that the projected loss matches the manual calculation. | `test_stress_scenarios.py`. |

---

## 7️⃣ Explainability Dashboard

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 7.1 | **SHAP for technical features** – after each RL inference, compute SHAP values for the technical indicator slice and store them in `explainability` table. |
| 7.2 | **LLM rationale extraction** – parse the `rationale` field returned by each agent, tag key phrases (e.g., “ETF approval”, “exchange hack”) using a lightweight NER model, and visualise frequency per symbol. |
| 7.3 | **Attribution of P&L** – allocate each realised profit/loss to the contributing data sources (technical, news, on‑chain) using a linear regression on the feature vector of the entry trade. |
| 7.4 | **Grafana panels** – heatmaps of SHAP importance over time, word‑cloud of LLM rationales, and a stacked bar chart of P&L attribution. |
| 7.5 | **Unit‑test** – generate a deterministic observation, run the RL policy, compute SHAP, and assert that the sum of SHAP values ≈ model output (within tolerance). |

---

## 8️⃣ Chaos Engineering & Performance Testing

| # | Sub‑task | Done‑criterion |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 8.1 | **Network latency injection** – use **Chaos Mesh** to add 500 ms latency between the orchestrator and the exchange API; verify that the order‑router’s timeout handling still prevents stale orders. |
| 8.2 | **CPU‑stress on LLM agents** – throttle CPU to 20 % for the `NewsAgent` pod; ensure the orchestrator falls back to the remaining agents and the aggregated confidence degrades gracefully. |
| 8.3 | **Load‑test ingestion** – with `k6`, push 200 k messages/minute into the Kafka topics; confirm that the consumer lag stays < 5 seconds and autoscaling adds pods. |
| 8.4 | **End‑to‑end latency budget** – measure from market‑data receipt → order‑submission; must stay < 2 seconds 95 % of the time. |
| 8.5 | **Automated regression test** – after each CI run, a script checks that the latency budget is still met; failure blocks the merge. |

---

## 9️⃣ Documentation, Run‑Books & SOPs

| # | Item | Done‑criterion |
|---|------|----------------|
| 9.1 | **Incident‑Response Playbook** – steps for: (a) exchange outage, (b) LLM API outage, (c) runaway RL policy, (d) security breach. Includes run‑book scripts (`./scripts/handle_exchange_outage.sh`). |
| 9.2 | **Model‑Upgrade SOP** – version bump, validation checklist, canary rollout, post‑deployment monitoring window, rollback criteria. |
| 9.3 | **Regulatory‑Reporting Guide** – mapping of required fields to ledger columns, schedule for daily/weekly reports, GDPR data‑subject request workflow. |
| 9.4 | **Disaster‑Recovery Plan** – backup strategy (daily snapshots of TimescaleDB, S3 versioned objects for model checkpoints), fail‑over cluster diagram, RTO/RPO targets. |
| 9.5 | **Knowledge‑Base** – Confluence/Notion pages with architecture diagrams, data‑flow charts, and a “FAQ for new engineers”. |
| 9.6 | **Unit‑test** – run a linting script that checks all markdown files for required sections (`## Incident Response`). |

## 11️⃣ Sprint 5 Demo Checklist

1. **Deploy to a fresh Kubernetes cluster** with a single `helm upgrade --install` command. All pods become Ready, HPA scales up when you run the load‑test script.  
2. **Show the meta‑learning selector** picking different policies for two symbols (e.g., `BTC‑USD` uses `rl_v2`, `SOL‑USDT` uses `hybrid_v1`). The Grafana panel displays the selected policy per symbol.  
3. **Run the Optuna hyper‑parameter job** (visible in the UI), then demonstrate that the new checkpoint is automatically promoted after the validation KPI passes.  
4. **Trigger a chaos experiment** (kill the `news_agent` pod). The orchestrator logs a timeout, the aggregated confidence drops, and the fallback policy takes over – all without order loss.  
5. **Open the audit‑trail UI** – verify that each trade row contains a `prev_hash` column, and that the daily compliance CSV can be downloaded via the `/report/daily` endpoint.  
6. **Display the Explainability Dashboard** – show SHAP heatmap for a recent trade, the word‑cloud of LLM rationales, and the P&L attribution bar chart.  
7. **Simulate a regulatory data‑subject request** – call the deletion API, then query the ledger to confirm the user‑related fields are scrubbed while the hash chain remains valid.  
8. **Execute the kill‑switch** (`POST /shutdown`). All open positions on all three exchanges are closed, the system writes a final “system_stopped” entry, and the Helm release is marked `STOPPED`.  

When the demo passes, the platform is **production‑ready**, **self‑optimising**, and **compliant**—ready to be handed over to operations or to be further expanded (e.g., adding new asset classes, integrating on‑chain execution, or launching on additional clouds).
