# Created with deepseek-v2.5:236b-q8_0

Creating an automated system to make money on DeFi involves several complex components, including interacting with various protocols, managing risk, optimizing for yield, and ensuring security. Below is a high-level implementation outline using Python and popular libraries like `web3.py` for Ethereum interactions, `requests` for API calls, and `pandas` for data analysis. This example will focus on measuring opportunities across lending, staking, yield farming, liquidity provision, and governance token farming, then executing trades to maximize gains while minimizing risk.

### Prerequisites:
1. **Install Required Libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install web3 requests pandas numpy
   ```
2. **Set Up Infura or Another Ethereum Node Provider:**
   - Sign up for an account on [Infura](https://infura.io/) and get your API key.

### Step 1: Define the Environment
```python
from web3 import Web3
import requests
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import time

# Connect to Ethereum network via Infura
infura_url = "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<your_project_id>"
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(infura_url))

# Check if connected
if web3.isConnected():
    print("Successfully connected to Ethereum network.")
else:
    raise Exception("Failed to connect to Ethereum network.")
```

### Step 2: Define Functions for Each DeFi Opportunity
#### A. Lending
```python
def get_lending_rates(platform):
    # Example API call to fetch lending rates from a platform like Compound or Aave
    url = f"https://api.{platform}.com/v2/lending-rates"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

#### B. Staking
```python
def get_staking_yields(platform):
    # Example API call to fetch staking yields from a platform like Yearn or Curve
    url = f"https://api.{platform}.com/v2/staking-yields"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

#### C. Yield Farming
```python
def get_yield_farming_opportunities(platform):
    # Example API call to fetch yield farming opportunities from a platform like Uniswap or SushiSwap
    url = f"https://api.{platform}.com/v2/yield-farming"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

#### D. Liquidity Provision
```python
def get_liquidity_provision_rewards(platform):
    # Example API call to fetch liquidity provision rewards from a platform like Uniswap or Balancer
    url = f"https://api.{platform}.com/v2/liquidity-rewards"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

#### E. Governance Token Farming
```python
def get_governance_token_farming(platform):
    # Example API call to fetch governance token farming opportunities from a platform like Compound or MakerDAO
    url = f"https://api.{platform}.com/v2/governance-farming"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()
```

### Step 3: Measure and Compare Opportunities
```python
def compare_opportunities():
    platforms = ["compound", "aave", "yearn", "curve", "uniswap", "sushiswap", "balancer", "makerdao"]
    opportunities = {
        'lending': [],
        'staking': [],
        'yield_farming': [],
        'liquidity_provision': [],
        'governance_token_farming': []
    }
    
    for platform in platforms:
        lending_rates = get_lending_rates(platform)
        staking_yields = get_staking_yields(platform)
        yield_farming = get_yield_farming_opportunities(platform)
        liquidity_rewards = get_liquidity_provision_rewards(platform)
        governance_farming = get_governance_token_farming(platform)
        
        opportunities['lending'].append(lending_rates)
        opportunities['staking'].append(staking_yields)
        opportunities['yield_farming'].append(yield_farming)
        opportunities['liquidity_provision'].append(liquidity_rewards)
        opportunities['governance_token_farming'].append(governance_farming)
    
    # Convert to DataFrame for easier analysis
    df = pd.DataFrame(opportunities)
    return df
```

### Step 4: Execute Trades and Rebalance
```python
def execute_trade(platform, action, amount):
    # Example function to execute a trade on a DeFi platform
    url = f"https://api.{platform}.com/v2/{action}"
    payload = {'amount': amount}
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
    return response.json()

def rebalance_portfolio():
    df = compare_opportunities()
    
    # Determine the most lucrative opportunity
    best_opportunity = df.idxmax().values[0]  # Simplified for example
    
    if best_opportunity == 'lending':
        execute_trade('compound', 'deposit', 100)  # Example amount
    elif best_opportunity == 'staking':
        execute_trade('yearn', 'stake', 100)
    elif best_opportunity == 'yield_farming':
        execute_trade('uniswap', 'farm', 100)
    elif best_opportunity == 'liquidity_provision':
        execute_trade('balancer', 'provide_liquidity', 100)
    elif best_opportunity == 'governance_token_farming':
        execute_trade('makerdao', 'farm_governance', 100)
    
    print(f"Rebalanced portfolio to {best_opportunity}")
```

### Step 5: Real-Time Status Reporting and Dry Run Feature
```python
def report_status():
    # Example function to fetch current portfolio status from a DeFi platform
    url = "https://api.yourdefiplatform.com/v2/portfolio"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

def dry_run(eth_amount):
    df = compare_opportunities()
    
    # Simulate potential gains based on the provided ETH amount
    simulated_gains = {}
    for opportunity in df.columns:
        simulated_gains[opportunity] = df[opportunity].max() * eth_amount  # Simplified calculation
    
    print("Simulated Gains:", simulated_gains)
```

### Step 6: Main Loop to Run the System
```python
def main():
    while True:
        rebalance_portfolio()
        status = report_status()
        print("Current Portfolio Status:", status)
        
        # Dry run feature
        eth_amount = float(input("Enter ETH amount for dry run: "))
        dry_run(eth_amount)
        
        time.sleep(3600)  # Rebalance every hour (adjust as needed)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Conclusion
This code provides a high-level framework for an automated DeFi trading system that measures various opportunities, executes trades to maximize gains while minimizing risk, and reports real-time status. The dry run feature allows users to simulate potential gains based on user-defined ETH amounts. This is a simplified example, and in practice, you would need to handle more complex logic, error handling, security considerations, and possibly integrate with specific DeFi protocols' SDKs or APIs for accurate data fetching and trade execution.
