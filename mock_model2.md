# Tax Structure: Gold Supply & Revenue Sharing Arrangement

## Tax Implications for Both Parties

| **Party** | **Tax Classification** | **Tax Obligations** | **Potential Advantages** |
|:----------|:----------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------------|
| **You (Gold Supplier)** | Investment income (likely passive) [1][3] | • Income tax on revenue share<br>• Potential capital gains tax when selling gold [1][3][7] | • Likely avoids self-employment tax<br>• Could qualify for investment income treatment [3][5] |
| **LLC (Recipient)** | Business expense and revenue [2][6] | • Deducts payment to you<br>• Reports full sales as revenue<br>• Pays tax on net income [2][6] | • Clear business expense deduction<br>• Straightforward accounting [4][6] |

## How Your Tax Structure Works

### 1. Your Tax Treatment as Supplier

* **Revenue Share Payments**
  * Classified as investment income rather than self-employment income [1][3]
  * Reported on Schedule E (Supplemental Income) rather than Schedule C [3][7]
  * Subject to ordinary income tax rates but likely exempt from self-employment tax [5][7]
  * LLC should provide you with Form 1099-MISC (Box 3: Other Income) [4][7]

* **Gold Ownership**
  * No immediate tax impact from supplying gold (no "sale" occurs) [1][7]
  * When gold is eventually sold or liquidated, may trigger capital gains [1][7]
  * Gold is considered a "collectible" with long-term capital gains taxed at 28% maximum rate [7]

* **Record-Keeping Requirements**
  * Maintain records of all gold purchases (cost basis)
  * Track revenue share payments received
  * Document any gold returned and its disposition [2][5]

### 2. LLC's Tax Treatment as Recipient

* **Revenue Reporting**
  * LLC reports 100% of jewelry sales as business revenue [2][6]
  * Your 40% share is a deductible expense for the LLC [4][6]
  * Gold used in production is treated as "cost of goods sold" [2]

* **Tax Forms**
  * LLC must issue Form 1099-MISC to you for payments over $600 annually [4]
  * LLC deducts payments to you on its tax return (Form 1065 or Schedule C) [2][6]

* **Inventory Tracking**
  * LLC must maintain clear records distinguishing your gold from other materials
  * Should document when your gold is incorporated into finished products [2][5]

## Tax Strategies and Considerations

### For You (Supplier):

1. **Maintain "Passive Investor" Status**
   * Limit involvement to supplying gold and receiving payments
   * Avoid participating in business decisions or operations
   * Document limited time commitment (under 500 hours annually) [1][3][5]

2. **Proper Documentation**
   * Ensure agreement clearly establishes investment relationship
   * Keep all receipts for gold purchases (establishes cost basis)
   * Maintain separate financial accounts for this activity [2][5]

3. **Consider Timing**
   * Revenue share payments are taxable in the year received
   * Gold appreciation isn't taxable until sold [1][7]

### For the LLC:

1. **Clear Accounting Separations**
   * Track your gold separately from other materials
   * Document when your gold is used in production
   * Clearly identify revenue share payments as business expenses [2][4][6]

2. **Proper Tax Reporting**
   * Issue correct Form 1099 for your payments
   * Maintain documentation supporting the business arrangement
   * Properly classify payments in tax filings [4][6]
