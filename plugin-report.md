Plug-in Hybrids & Small EVs — Cheapest to Most Expensive (Private-Party U.S. Market)

Order	Model (typical years you’ll find)	Private-party price range*	Support level	At-risk / losing support components

1	Ford C-Max Energi (2012-2017)	$5k – $8k	Moderate	Some hybrid control modules, SYNC electronics, older proprietary ECUs can be hard to source; consumables widely available.
2	Chevy Volt (Gen1 2011-2015, Gen2 2016-2019)	$6k – $10k	Low → Moderate	Battery Energy Control Module (BECM), inverter/charger electronics, some interior electronics on backorder; salvage parts common but OEM sometimes scarce.
3	Fiat 500e (2013-2016)	$6k – $9k	Low	EV-specific modules, body trim, charger parts; Stellantis’ pauses on 500e production raise uncertainty.
4	Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV (2018-2019 older imports)	$8k – $12k	Moderate → High	HV drive components can be pricey/delayed; otherwise decent dealer support.
5	Kia Niro PHEV / Hyundai Ioniq PHEV (2017-2019)	$9k – $14k	High	Charging control units, inverter modules sometimes recalled or on longer lead times.
6	Honda Clarity PHEV (2018-2020)	$12k – $18k	High → Moderate	Unique Clarity electronics, trim panels, certain body parts sometimes on national backorder; shared Honda parts easy to find.
7	Toyota Prius Prime / Prius PHEV (2017+)	$14k – $20k+	High (best)	Very few risks; rare inverter/charger components may have lead times but Toyota dealer support is excellent.


*Price ranges are typical private-party sale estimates in the U.S. (higher in clean markets, lower for high-miles or rough condition). In Milwaukee/Wisconsin, expect to see C-Max/Volt/500e in the $6k–$9k band, Clarity closer to $14k, Prius Prime almost always above $15k.

Notes on Ordering

$7k target → You’ll realistically only see C-Max Energi, Volt, or Fiat 500e.

Stretching to $10k → You start to open Outlander PHEV and some high-mile Niro/Ioniq PHEVs.

Above $12k → Now you can access Clarity and Prius Prime, both with the best long-term support.

⚡ Quick buyer’s tip:
If your kid just needs something cheap and plug-in under $7k, the Ford C-Max Energi is the most realistic bet — easier to support than Volt/500e, still has Ford dealer parts channels. The Volt is a close second but higher risk for electronic modules. The 500e is cheapest city EV fun, but parts support is weakest.
